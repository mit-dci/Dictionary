A lisiting of terminology for internal consistent use at the DCI, but published to serve as reference externally. PR's welcome!

Ideally, we will tag a release once this is somewhat populated. We should probably standardize capitalization.

The tricky part is that upper-case bitcoin might mean something different than lower-case, but suggest that we use uppercase for everything on this list and note anything that should be in lower case. - Joi
